                    Music production technology has been on quite the journey, and we've come a long way since the days of Jim Morrison and The Doors.
                    Like, who knew we'd come so far? Jim. Jim did know we'd come so far. He's just THAT guy.
                    Back in '69, Jim Morrison hinted that the future would be all about machines making music.
                    Fast forward to today, and with a modest budget, your home computer can be transformed into a mini music studio.
                    Who needs friends anyway when you've got synths, right? Platforms have sprung up everywhere,
                    catering to every musical need from sharing samples to mastering the art through tutorials.
                    And now? AI's stepping into the spotlight, with online platforms offering futuristic services like AI mastering.
                    <br><br>
                    But, theres is a problem in this market. Many of these platforms are like those all-you-can-eat buffets that only serve salad.
                    Often they only offer a single feature, for example sharing samples. Some of these services are free, others are paid.
                    That is where <a href="https://bangerly.com" class="code-font underline decoration-sky-500 underline-offset-4">bangerly</a> comes in.
                    Think of Bangerly as your one-stop-shop for all things music production, or better said the entire mall.
                    From samples to complete sample packs, MIDI files to synth presets, Networking statistics to nifty AI tools. Yup, we got the goods!
                    And the cost? Let's just say it won't have you living on instant noodles like the other platforms, with some features even for (partly) free, so don't worry!.
                    <br><br>
                    So, Which features are done and which aren't? As said, Bangerly is a unique platform that provides a library of audio samples for music enthusiasts.
                    That same library is built by the community, as artists can upload samples, and download others.
                    Artist can view statistics about their downloads, likes and profile clicks, so they can monitor to process of building a network with other producers.
                    What truly sets Bangerly apart is its commitment to fostering a community. As described earlier, the goal is to bring multiple topics of music production together in one platform, for the fraction of the price of its competitors that only cover 1 topic.
                    It's not just about downloading samples; it's about sharing, creating, and growing together.
                    <br><br>
                    Now, let's be real, Bangerly is still a baby. It's our debut app!
                    Lots of the features are still in the lab, such as AI vocal separation,
                    AI sample generation and the ability for artists to sell their own samplepack.

                        As with most sample library platforms, a user can search for a sample or artist.
                        But with our platform, an artist that optionally uploads a sample can attach a MIDI file
                        (a type of file that basically contains a melody, that a DAW can use to put another synth over).
                        The artist can also optionally attach a synth preset file (so that the sound is reproducable and adjustable).
                        Although this is a small extra feature, it sure leaves artists with more resources to produce their tracks.

                        Artists can also chat with each other. These features may not be the core topic of the app, but it is important so that different producers
                        can collaborate and build a network with each other.

                        Besides individual samples, Bangerly hosts complete sample packs that users can download.
                        Sample Packs are more popular for the at-home producer, and sometimes an artist does not want to give away his/her samples for free.
                        That's why we give artists the ability to sell their sample packs on our platform.
